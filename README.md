GATE EXAM CLEARED!

I recently received my results for the GATE exam for Computer Science and Information Technology held in February 2024 and I successfully cleared it with a score of 42.33. 

With a GATE score of 511 and an All India Rank of 5101, this milestone marks a significant point in my educational journey.

This achievement is a testament to the dedication and hard work invested in understanding the complexities of my field. It’s a reminder of the support and encouragement received from teachers and peers alike, for which I’m deeply grateful.

Looking forward, I’m eager to apply what I’ve learned, embracing both the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in technology and innovation. Thank you to everyone who’s been a part of this journey with me and congratulations to everyone who has cleared the exam.
